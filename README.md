# flashcard-generator



In this app you will create flashcards with questions and answers!

Basic flashcards, which have a front ("Who was the first president of the United States?"), and a back ("George Washington").

Cloze-Deleted flashcards, which present partial text ("... was the first president of the United States."), and the full text when the user requests it ("George Washington was the first president of the United States.")
